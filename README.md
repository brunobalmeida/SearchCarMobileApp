# Search Car Mobile App  

This is a mobile application designed for the quality course at Conestoga College. The App is a simple mobile app to search for cars at the jdpower.com website.    

It uses jQuery mobile as the main language, together with HTML5 and CSS3. The database is local and created by the app. As the main reason for creating the repository is to share knowlegde and basic skills on different programming languages, the apk is not available here only the main code. Although it can be easily created using Cordova, and if you need any help to do it just email me and I send you a step-by-step guide.    

Some of the example features that can be found here are: 
* Form validation
* jQuery Mobile syntax 
* Database creation using jQuery (local Db)
* LocalStorage usage
* Dynamic content using jQuery
